"In order to achieve secure communications during the payment transaction, symmetric and
asymmetric cryptography are used normally among engaging customers. Most of the protocols
in recent years are developed on public-key infrastructure (PKI) [10, 11, 12, 13] where as the
remaining employ symmetric key operations [14, 15]. However, the security protocols using
symmetric-key operations consume lower computations at all the engaging parties and they are
good enough to support transaction security properties such as party authentication, transaction
privacy, transaction integrity, and non-repudiation. The proposed architecture ensures high level
security and convenience using symmetric key operations."

Propose a new design for remote macro-payments on WTLS with 5 entities: Mobile client, Mobile Payment Application Service Provider (MPASP) server, Client bank, Merchant and Merchant bank

Defines how they meet requirements like privacy, non-repuditian
