Electronic commerce (e-commerce) has since its introduction in 1990 become very popular, with 21% of payments being done through online payments in 2012. It was estimated that 95% of all e-commerce in 2004 was done through the use of credit cards.

"The future of a specific electronic payment system depends upon how it overcomes the practical and
analytical challenges faced by various means of online payments. These challenges include issues of law and regulation (buyer and seller protection), technological capabilities of e-payment service providers, commercial relationships, and security considerations such as verification and authentication issues (Paunov and Vickery,2006)."

Credit cards:

- More secure than credit cards due to higher identification requirements

Mobile payments
- Convenient (Hoofnagle, et al. (2012))

Requirements for an electronic payment system
- SSL or SET
- Confidentiality of information shared by consumers
- Data integrity
- Authentication of all the participants
- Non-repudiation
- End-user requirements:
-- Usability

Requirements for adoption (Mallat 2007):
- Convenient - mobile payment foud to be the most convenient for small payments
- Complexity - Smart cards and mobile payments are too complex and therefore has received less adoption, it is to be expected that mobile payments will become less complex
- Costs - Users refrained from mobile payment methods because of high pricing.
- Security - A very important point. A major barrier in adoption to e-commerce transactions

Karp (2015) notes that one of the major challenges for mobile payment systems is the increasing rate of cyber-crime that results in data theft and cyber-attacks on financial data.

"Radio barcodes technology is believed to be a revolutionary addition to mobile payments systems"
- Can be used to locate things a tag is embedded on
