- Generic Architecture of M-payments
The M-payment Application Service Provider (MASP) provides the necessary hardware / software and acts as an intermediary between the consumer and the merchant. The MASP has user info and has their info mapped to their bank account details.
1. The consumer delivers identification information, like a phone number or a username to the merchant
2. the merchant requests payment
3. The consumer confirms the request and authorizes payment
4. The MASP receives authorization and verifies the authenticity.
5. The MASP debits the customer and credits the merchant by interacting with the bank.
6. Both parties receive a confirmation
